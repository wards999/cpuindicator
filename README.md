# A tiny Windows 10 / 11 taskbar icon to show CPU activity



I needed to be able to quickly check the cpu usage for my PC without opening Task Manager

I wanted a very lightweight app as alternative tools I looked at used more CPU / RAM than I would have liked





## A quick review of the UI

(Right click / Settings once running in the task bar area)
